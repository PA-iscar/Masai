1. What are some new things happening in the web?
   <br/>
   Ans: Web development and Internet in general is relatively a new technology, and it is evolving at a breakneck speed every passing year. New website technologies are being discovered as developers explore new ways of innovation. I believe that the Web development industry will be revolutionised again when technologies like AI, VR, Blockchain, and Cloud computing become a standard for every website. Vendors like AWS and Google Cloud functions already support Serverless architecture(hosting and server software and hardware managed by third party). By using Cloud computing, Developeres can work on the same project from different locations and the load on user devices is reduced as the computation is done on the cloud. Responsive Websites and Dark mode are also in trend as it makes user experience more plesant.

1. Explain a project that you have built?
   <br/>
   Ans: I recently worked on a full-stack project. After learning the skills required to be a full-stack developer, I wanted to test if my knowledge was practical or just theoretical. So, along with my team, I started working on an E-commerce website clone named Freshmenu. Freshmenu is a neighbourhood food delivery website. And Since their menus change every day, they stand out from the throng of eateries that offer a fixed menu. The tech stack that we used for the front-end is React, React-Redux,and Ant Design Library and for the back-end part we used NodeJS, Express JS, MongoDB Atlas,and passport library for Google OAuth and we also used Git for the collaboration part. I personally worked on the database and back-end endpoints for creating and managing the flow of data, Authorization feature on the frontend by OTP and by using Google Oauth feature, managing our codebase on GitHub, and last but not least connecting the frontend with the backend. And we did face some challenges during the development phase. All of us were either working or studying full time so we weren't always available at the same time. and we overcame this by connecting every day on zoom and using GitHub and WhatsApp to keep track of our collective progress. We were 3 members in total and it took us 1 week to complete this project. We learned a lot during that week and I realised that planning beforehand is really important.

1. Whats something exciting that you have built?
   <br/>
   Ans: Every feature that I code is interesting to me, that is one of the reasons that I enjoy coding, but if I have to choose I'll go with the website project named roberto that is one of my finest work, in that project I built some parallax effects, a dual ended range selector slidebar and a responsive navbar all from scratch.

1. What are you most excited about?
   <br/>
   Ans: The thing that excites me most is the fact that Web Development is a new field and there is still a lot to create and a lot to discover. And we live in an era that offers a lot of hands-on learning opportunities and our generation will get to experience something revolutionary and no one can predict what it could be. Once you learn how to code, you have access to a powerful system for solving problems. The learning never stops, either. There is always a new coding technique to learn that will help you solve even harder problems. There is always an existing solution that you can enhance.

1. Why do coding standards matter? What are some patterns you follow?
   <br/>
   Ans: Coding standards are importand as the create consistency among programmers, improve readability, and maintainability of the code and they also help to ensure security and reliability. Some of the patterns that I follow is creating limited and only reqired amount of global variables, basic naming convention for variables and constants, proper indentation and exception handling as well.

1. How do you go about managing responsive websites?
   <br/>
   Ans: Responsive websites are really easy to create relative to creating standalone websites for different devices. Using a pre-designed theme or layout can save a lot of time, but if I was building a website from scratch, I'd use these techniques for responsive designs, Using responsive images and videos, starting with a fluid structure and setting appropriate media query breakpoints. Mobile first design approach also helps, as the name suggests we start by creating the mobile design which is more restrictive and then expand our design to bigger screen sizes.

1. What do you care about the most when you write software?
   <br/>
   Ans: Good code is something not only understood by the person who is writing it at the time of writing it, but also understood by the persons future self and anyone who will ever interact with the code in whole and in parts, by "in parts" I mean, if someone opens some module or function in the code, they should be able to understand it without going through the entire codebase. Following the coding standards is a huge part of this and My code being error free and easy to understand is something that I focus on the most.
