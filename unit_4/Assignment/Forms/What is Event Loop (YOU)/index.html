    <h1>Event Loop</h1>
    <div>
        <h3>Call Stack</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language and can only do one thing at a time, it create the
            execution contexts and pushes and pops functions onto and off the call stack.<br><br>A blocking function such as a
            function that downloads a file from a remote server or calls an API from an external server can block all
            interactions of the webpage and if it takes a long time to execute, the user cannot interact with the web
            browser during the function's execution because the page hangs. For example:
        </p>

        <img src="sync.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            In this example, the task() function emulates a time-consuming task. <br><br>The task() function is the
            blocking function. <br>
            The script hangs for a few seconds and creates the following output:
        </p>

        <img src="sync_result.jpg" class="result" alt="">

        <p>
            to execute the script, the JavaScript engine places the first call console.log() on top of the stack and
            executes it.<br><br>Then, JavaScript places the task() function on top of the call stack and executes the function.
            However, it'll take a while to complete the task() function.<br>Therefore, you'll see the message 'Download a
            file.' a little time later. After the task() function completes, the JavaScript engine pops it off the call
            stack. <br>
            Finally, the JavaScript engine places the last call to the console.log('Done!') function and executes it,
            which will be very fast.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>WEB API</h3>
        <p>
            To prevent a blocking function from blocking other activities, we put in a callback function for later
            execution. For example:
        </p>

        <img src="async.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            In this example, you'll see the message 'Start script...' and 'Done!' immediately. And after that, you'll
            see the message 'Download a file'.
        </p>

        <img src="async_result.jpg" alt="">

        <p>
            JavaScript runtime can do only one thing at time. However, the web browser has other components, not just
            the JavaScript engine. <br> The setTimeout(), fetch requests, and DOM events are parts of the Web APIs of the web
            browser and can be executed concurrently and asynchronously. <br> In our example, when you call the setTimeout()
            function, the JavaScript engine places it on the call stack, and the Web API creates a timer that expires in
            1 second.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Callback Queue</h3>
        <p>
            After the timer expires in the WEB API, JavaScript engine places the task() function into a queue known as a
            Callback Queue or an Event Queue.
        </p>

        <img src="queue.jpg" alt="">
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Event Loop</h3>
        <p>
            The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the call stack. <br> If
            the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function from the
            callback queue to the call stack. <br> If the callback queue is empty, nothing will happen:
        </p>
