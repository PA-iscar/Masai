### Goals for learning Context hook

- [x] Create a context by the name AuthContext
- [x] create a AuthContextProvider component which will wrap the entire application around it
- [x] create a isAuth and a toggleAuth function
- [x] pass these values into your context provider
- [x] create a navbar with a button to login or logout (change with the isAuth variable)
- [x] use the reqres.in api for login to achieve this task
- [x] create another component which will display the login status of the user along with the token
- [x] these two components should not share props and the app state should be accessed through the context api
